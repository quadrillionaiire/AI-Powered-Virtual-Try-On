# AI Powered Virtual Try-On: Redefining E-Commerce with Augmented Reality

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered virtual try-on tool leveraging augmented reality (AR) and lightweight machine learning (ML) models. The prototype will allow users to overlay clothing items on their live camera feed in real-time, enhancing customer engagement for e-commerce platforms and empowering a new era of online shopping convenience.

## Motivation
The goal is to revolutionize the e-commerce experience by addressing the common pain point of not being able to try on clothes before purchase. This limitation leads to high return rates, increased costs for retailers, and frustration for consumers. By creating an interactive and personalized shopping experience, the virtual try-on tool will reduce return rates and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Project Roadmap

### Minimum Viable Product (V1)
- **Pose detection and alignment of clothing items using live camera feeds.**
- **GUI for toggling between 5-10 curated clothing items.**
- **Implementation using Tkinter or similar.**

### Version 2 (V2)
- **Improved alignment with enhanced body keypoint accuracy.**
- **Expanded clothing catalog.**
- **Basic optimization for Raspberry Pi hardware.**

### Version 3 (V3)
- **Advanced features like interactive toggling using sensors.**
- **Integration with e-commerce APIs.**
- **Scalable architecture for future product recommendations.**

### Future Versions (Truck/Rocket Ship)
- **Full-scale deployment with white-label licensing options.**
- **AI-driven personalization and VR integration.**

## Key Technologies
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, TensorFlow Lite, Mediapipe, OpenCV, Tkinter, PyQt.
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 5, camera module.
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow Lite for ML optimization, Mediapipe for pose detection.
- **Future Integrations:** ARCore/ARKit for cross-platform scalability, REST APIs for e-commerce.

## Milestones & Weekly Goals

### Week 1: Setup and Research
- Install necessary libraries and test camera functionality on Raspberry Pi.
- Explore pre-trained models like Mediapipe for pose detection.
- Curate clothing image datasets (e.g., Kaggle's Marquis Viton).

### Week 2: Core Development
- Implement pose detection and body keypoint mapping.
- Develop clothing overlay functionality.
- Create GUI for easy selection of items.

### Week 3: Integration & Optimization
- Add interaction features (gestures/sensors for toggling).
- Optimize performance for real-time rendering.
- Conduct usability testing.

## Business Value
- **Stakeholders:** E-commerce platforms, Gen Z consumers, retailers.
- **Metrics:** Model accuracy, system performance, user feedback.
- **Data Sources:** Kaggle datasets (Marquis Viton, DeepFashion), custom clothing images.

## Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring user privacy when using camera feeds.
- Inclusivity for diverse body types.
